#formulas and examples for probabilistic independence
#3 conditions of probabilistic independence

#1: P(A|B) = P(A)
#2: P(B|A) = P(B)
#3: P(A ∩ B) = P(A)*P(B)

#Independent does not mean mutually exclusive and therefore..
#P(A U B) != P(A)+P(B)  there is still a likelihood of an intersection. That likelihood is however not at all influenced by one of the other events occurring. 

#Prob of being exposed to both a billboard and a commercial for the same product. P(B) = .4  P(C) = .2. Both or independent events.

Pb = .4
Pc = .2
i = .4*.2
print('P(B∩C): ',round(i,2))

#The probability of the intersection of various ind. events is therefore P(e1)*P(e2)*P(e3)...P(e4)

#Free throw shooting of p% shooting average shooting 10 free throws.
P = .95
n = 10

print('prob of making all baskets: ', round(P**n,2))

#The probability of the union of independent events:
# P(A1 U A2 U A3 ... U Ai)
# = 1-(P(Acomp1)*(Acomp2)*(Acomp3)...Acompi))

#Ex: I'm shooting 3 free-throws in bball. Assuming all my shots are independent, and I shoot with a scoring % of p, what is the % I'll make at least one shot? 

P = .7
n = 3
print('P(of at least one made basket out of n shots: ',1-(1-P)**n)

#ex2 probability of there being rotten wine in a bottle = 10%
#in batch of 10, what's the prob that at least 1 will be rotten.

P=.1
n = 10
print('P(rotten wine bottle: ', round(1-(1-.1)**n,2))
