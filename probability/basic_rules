#basic probability
#incls = [rule of compliments, rule of unions, prob of mutually exclusive events]

#rule of compliments: essentially if the probability of event A occuring is P(A), what  the prob of event A not occuring?

#rule of unions: if there are two events in our probability space, what is the total probability of one, or both of the events occuring? 

#P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
