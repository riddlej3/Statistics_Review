#conditional probability
#finds the probability of an event A given the occurence another event, event B in our case.

# P(A ∩ B)
# --------- = P(A|B) #probability of A given B.
#   P(B)

#a boy is going to ask two girls out on a date. The boy thinks his probability of getting girl1 to say yes is .40 and that the probability of getting both girl1 and 2 to say yes is .1. What is the probability therefore of getting girl 2 to say yes given the probability that girl1 says yes?

i = .1
g1 = .4

print('prob of g2 given g1: ',round(.1/.4,2))

#an alternative equation you'll see if we change around the components of the equation is = 

# P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) * P(B)

#if a consulting firm is vying for 2 jobs and know that the P(A) = .6 and that the P(B|A) = .5 what is P(A ∩ B)?

a2 = .6
ba = .5

print('P(intersect ab): ', .6 *.5)

#40% of execs are women
#21% of execs are top salary
#6.4% woman and top salary level execs
#is the number of women earning top salary the expected % given our information?

#  P(W ∩ TS)
#  --------   = P(TS)
#    P(W)

print('Expected(TS | P(W ∩ TS): ',.064/.4)
